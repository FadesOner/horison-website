# Horiseon website homework

The main priority for this assignment was to correct issues within an HTML and CSS document. For example, there were broken links, disorganised semantic elements and photos lacking attributes.

I started by changing all the <div> into <section> and <nav> and <articles>. These steps help organise the HTML better.

In the <header> I fixed the misssing ID which helped me correct all the problems with the links.

I added the name of the website to the <title>.

In the CSS, I grouped all the elements with a class together to avoid repeat elements on the section of benefit and content.
